   **Comparison:** The good prompt's result gave specific information and wrote the specific style we want while the bad prompt lacked informations about the kind of party and didn't know the style of the email.

2. ### Scenario: You need help understanding photosynthesis for a presentation

   **Prompt:**

   Create a presentation about photosynthesis:
   
   \- Audience: Children (8 to 11 years old)
   
   \- Story: a flower laying on the grass like a dead plant. the sun rises and shines on the flower. the flower gets the light from the sun and stands up like its born again.

   \- Diagram description: There is a sun shining on the sunflower. Show water on the root of the sunflower. Demostrates that the leaves have carbon dioxide, oxygen, and carbohydrates.
  
   The result:

   #### Slide 1 – Title

   **Title:** The Magic of Photosynthesis
   
   **Image:** A sleepy flower lying on the grass.
   
   **Text:**

   > “Once upon a time, there was a tired little flower lying on the grass. It looked so weak—it needed something special to wake it up!”

   #### Slide 3 – What Is Photosynthesis?

   **Text:**

   > “Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight!”

   **Simple breakdown:**
   
   🌞 **Sunlight** – gives energy
   
   💧 **Water** – from the soil

   🌬️ **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)** – from the air

   **Result:**
   
   🍞 Food (carbohydrates) + 💨 Oxygen

   #### Slide 4 – The Flower’s Recipe

   **Text:**

   > “Plants have their own recipe for food!”

   | Ingredient	| Where it Comes From |
   |------------|---------------------|
   | Sunlight ☀️| From the sun |
   | Water 💧	| From the roots |
   | Carbon Dioxide 🌬️ | From the air |

   **Magic Oven:** The leaves are like the plant’s kitchen!

   #### Slide 5 – Diagram: How Photosynthesis Works

   **Diagram description (for your visual):**

   - A sunflower standing upright.
   - The sun shining down light rays labeled “Sunlight Energy”.
   - Water (H₂O) arrows coming from the soil into the roots.
   - Carbon dioxide (CO₂) arrows going into the leaves.
   - Oxygen (O₂) arrows going out from the leaves.
   - Inside the leaf, show a bubble labeled “Food (carbohydrates)”.
   - A caption: “The leaves make food and release oxygen!”
  
   -------------------

   #### Slide 6 – The Flower Wakes Up

   **Image:** The flower stands tall, smiling.
   **Text:**

   > “Thanks to photosynthesis, the flower is strong, healthy, and full of life again!”

   Narration idea:

   > “The Sun gave it power, the roots gave it water, and the air gave it carbon dioxide—together, they made food!”
   
   -------- 

   #### Slide 7 – Why It’s Important

   **Text:**

   >🌍 Plants make food for themselves.
   
   >💨 They give oxygen for us to breathe.
